description: Reduce visual intensity, saturation, and noise while preserving hierarchy and character. Use when the structure is basically sound but the design feels too loud, bold, garish, aggressive, or overstimulating—not when the real problem is structural clutter, too many features, or not enough personality.

Reduce visual intensity in designs that are too bold, aggressive, or overstimulating, creating a more refined and approachable aesthetic without losing effectiveness.

## MANDATORY PREPARATION

Users start this workflow with `/quieter`. Once this skill is active, load $frontend-design — it contains design principles, anti-patterns, and the **Context Gathering Protocol**. Follow that protocol before proceeding — if no design context exists yet, you MUST load $setup first.

Consult the [hierarchy checklist](../frontend-design/reference/hierarchy-checklist.md) when quieting the design depends on de-emphasis, grayscale hierarchy, or clearer action priority.
Consult the [spacing system](../frontend-design/reference/spacing-system.md) when calmness should come from better grouping and rhythm rather than just less saturation.
Consult the [personality levers](../frontend-design/reference/personality-levers.md) when the design needs to stay distinctive while becoming more restrained.
Consult the [ai slop detection](../frontend-design/reference/ai-slop-detection.md) when "quieter" risks drifting into generic, trend-safe blandness.
Consult the [surface separation](../frontend-design/reference/surface-separation.md) when removing intensity means using fewer borders, fewer unnecessary cards, quieter shadows, or calmer background shifts.

## Assess Current State

Analyze what makes the design feel too intense:

1. **Identify intensity sources**:
   - **Color saturation**: Overly bright or saturated colors
   - **Contrast extremes**: Too much high-contrast juxtaposition
   - **Visual weight**: Too many bold, heavy elements competing
   - **Animation excess**: Too much motion or overly dramatic effects
   - **Complexity**: Too many visual elements, patterns, or decorations
   - **Scale**: Everything is large and loud with no hierarchy

2. **Understand the context**:
   - What's the purpose? (Marketing vs tool vs reading experience)
   - Who's the audience? (Some contexts need energy)
   - What's working? (Don't throw away good ideas)
   - What's the core message? (Preserve what matters)

If any of these are unclear from the codebase, ask the user directly to clarify what you cannot infer.

**CRITICAL**: "Quieter" doesn't mean boring or generic. It means refined, sophisticated, and easier on the eyes. Think luxury, not laziness.

Quiet design usually comes from fewer competing decisions, not from draining all the life out of the interface.

## Plan Refinement

Create a strategy to reduce intensity while maintaining impact:

- **Color approach**: Desaturate or shift to more sophisticated tones?
- **Hierarchy approach**: Which elements should stay bold (very few), which should recede?
- **Simplification approach**: What can be removed entirely?
- **Sophistication approach**: How can we signal quality through restraint?
- **De-emphasis plan**: Which noisy elements should recede so the true focal point can stay strong?

**IMPORTANT**: Great quiet design is harder than great bold design. Subtlety requires precision.

## Refine the Design

Systematically reduce intensity across these dimensions:

### Color Refinement
- **Reduce saturation**: Shift from fully saturated to 70-85% saturation
- **Soften palette**: Replace bright colors with muted, sophisticated tones
- **Reduce color variety**: Use fewer colors more thoughtfully
- **Neutral dominance**: Let neutrals do more work, use color as accent (10% rule)
- **Gentler contrasts**: High contrast only where it matters most
- **Tinted grays**: Use warm or cool tinted grays instead of pure gray—adds sophistication without loudness
- **Never gray on color**: If you have gray text on a colored background, use a darker shade of that color or transparency instead
- **Preserve the anchor**: Keep enough contrast on the primary action or key message that the screen still has a focal point

### Visual Weight Reduction
- **Typography**: Reduce font weights (900 → 600, 700 → 500), decrease sizes where appropriate
- **Hierarchy through subtlety**: Use weight, size, and space instead of color and boldness
- **White space**: Increase breathing room, reduce density
- **Borders & lines**: Reduce thickness, decrease opacity, or remove entirely
- **Favor de-emphasis**: Often you should quiet the competing elements rather than weakening the most important one

### Simplification
- **Remove decorative elements**: Gradients, shadows, patterns, textures that don't serve purpose
- **Simplify shapes**: Reduce border radius extremes, simplify custom shapes
- **Reduce layering**: Flatten visual hierarchy where possible
- **Clean up effects**: Reduce or remove blur effects, glows, multiple shadows
- **Use spacing before separators**: Extra space or subtle background shifts often work better than another border

### Motion Reduction
- **Reduce animation intensity**: Shorter distances (10-20px instead of 40px), gentler easing
- **Remove decorative animations**: Keep functional motion, remove flourishes
- **Subtle micro-interactions**: Replace dramatic effects with gentle feedback
- **Refined easing**: Use ease-out-quart for smooth, understated motion—never bounce or elastic
- **Remove animations entirely** if they're not serving a clear purpose

### Composition Refinement
- **Reduce scale jumps**: Smaller contrast between sizes creates calmer feeling
- **Align to grid**: Bring rogue elements back into systematic alignment
- **Even out spacing**: Replace extreme spacing variations with consistent rhythm
- **Keep grouping clear**: Quiet layouts still need more space around groups than within them

**NEVER**:
- Make everything the same size/weight (hierarchy still matters)
- Remove all color (quiet ≠ grayscale)
- Eliminate all personality (maintain character through refinement)
- Sacrifice usability for aesthetics (functional elements still need clear affordances)
- Make everything small and light (some anchors needed)
- Quiet the focal point so much that the screen no longer has a clear center of gravity

## Verify Quality

Ensure refinement maintains quality:

- **Still functional**: Can users still accomplish tasks easily?
- **Still distinctive**: Does it have character, or is it generic now?
- **Better reading**: Is text easier to read for extended periods?
- **Sophistication**: Does it feel more refined and premium?

Remember: Quiet design is confident design. It doesn't need to shout. Less is more, but less is also harder. Refine with precision and maintain intentionality.
