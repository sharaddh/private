Assess and improve typography that feels generic, inconsistent, or poorly structured — turning default-looking text into intentional, well-crafted type.

## MANDATORY PREPARATION

Users start this workflow with `/typeset`. Once this skill is active, load $frontend-design — it contains design principles, anti-patterns, and the **Context Gathering Protocol**. Follow that protocol before proceeding — if no design context exists yet, you MUST load $setup first.

## Assess Current Typography

Analyze what's weak or generic about the current type:

1. **Font choices**:
   - Are we using invisible defaults? (Inter, Roboto, Arial, Open Sans, system defaults)
   - Does the font match the brand personality? (A playful brand shouldn't use a corporate typeface)
   - Are there too many font families? (More than 2-3 is almost always a mess)

2. **Hierarchy**:
   - Can you tell headings from body from captions at a glance?
   - Are font sizes too close together? (14px, 15px, 16px = muddy hierarchy)
   - Are weight contrasts strong enough? (Medium vs Regular is barely visible)

3. **Sizing & scale**:
   - Is there a consistent type scale, or are sizes arbitrary?
   - Does body text meet minimum readability? (16px+)
   - Is the sizing strategy appropriate for the context? (Fixed `rem` scales for app UIs; fluid `clamp()` for marketing/content page headings)

4. **Readability**:
   - Are line lengths comfortable? (45-75 characters ideal)
   - Is line-height appropriate for the font and context?
   - Is there enough contrast between text and background?
   - Are italics, underlines, and all-caps being used deliberately rather than as decoration?

5. **Consistency**:
   - Are the same elements styled the same way throughout?
   - Are font weights used consistently? (Not bold in one section, semibold in another for the same role)
   - Is letter-spacing intentional or default everywhere?
   - Is capitalization consistent by role? (titles, buttons, labels, toasts, metadata)

**CRITICAL**: The goal isn't to make text "fancier" — it's to make it clearer, more readable, and more intentional. Good typography is invisible; bad typography is distracting.

## Plan Typography Improvements

Consult the [typography reference](../frontend-design/reference/typography.md) from the frontend-design skill for detailed guidance on scales, pairing, loading strategies, and font-selection heuristics.
Consult the [text hierarchy and readability](../frontend-design/reference/text-hierarchy-and-readability.md) for line length, line-height, alignment, baseline, label/value handling, semantic-vs-visual hierarchy, link emphasis, and numeric alignment.
Consult the [hierarchy checklist](../frontend-design/reference/hierarchy-checklist.md) when typography problems are really hierarchy problems in disguise.

Treat the shared text hierarchy/readability reference as the common source for reading comfort and text-structure rules, then apply the typography-specific changes here.

Create a systematic plan:

- **Font selection**: Do fonts need replacing? What fits the brand/context?
- **Type scale**: Establish a constrained UI scale; use modular scales as inspiration, then hand-craft the actual steps you need
- **Weight strategy**: Which weights serve which roles? (Regular for body, Semibold for labels, Bold for headings — or whatever fits)
- **Spacing**: Line-heights, letter-spacing, and margins between typographic elements
- **Schema**: Are the typography roles documented clearly enough that future screens can stay consistent?

## Improve Typography Systematically

### Font Selection

If fonts need replacing:
- Choose fonts that reflect the brand personality
- Pair with genuine contrast (serif + sans, geometric + humanist) — or use a single family in multiple weights
- Prefer families with a healthy range of weights; families with more weights are usually more carefully built
- Optimize for legibility in UI text — avoid condensed display faces with short x-heights for body copy
- Ensure web font loading doesn't cause layout shift (`font-display: swap`, metric-matched fallbacks)

### Establish Hierarchy

Build a clear type scale:
- **5-7 sizes cover most needs**: caption, secondary, body, subheading, heading, display, optional eyebrow
- **Use ratios to explore, then commit to real values** that feel right in the interface
- **Combine dimensions**: Size + weight + color + space for strong hierarchy — don't rely on size alone
- **Use dramatic enough weight contrast** that the hierarchy is obvious; medium vs regular is often too subtle
- **App UIs**: Use a fixed `rem`-based type scale, optionally adjusted at 1-2 breakpoints. Fluid sizing undermines the spatial predictability that dense, container-based layouts need
- **Marketing / content pages**: Use fluid sizing via `clamp(min, preferred, max)` for headings and display text. Keep body text fixed

### Fix Readability

- Set `max-width` on text containers using `ch` units (`max-width: 65ch`)
- Keep most paragraphs in the 45-75 character range
- Adjust line-height per context: tighter for headings (1.1-1.2), looser for body (1.5-1.7)
- Increase line-height as line length increases; reduce it as font size gets larger
- Increase line-height slightly for light-on-dark text
- Ensure body text is at least 16px / 1rem

### Refine Details

- Use `tabular-nums` for data tables and numbers that should align
- Right-align numeric columns when comparison matters
- Align mixed-size text by the baseline when it appears on the same line
- Apply proper `letter-spacing`: slightly open for small caps and uppercase, default or slightly tighter for large display text
- Tighten headings selectively when the typeface is naturally loose at larger sizes
- Use italics sparingly: short emphasis, quotes, and testimonials are fine; long UI copy and controls are not
- Underline links and short key emphasis deliberately; do not blanket-underline dense text
- Keep capitalization consistent by role, and add tracking when using all-caps labels or metadata
- Don’t make every link bright blue by default; match link emphasis to its importance in the reading flow
- Use semantic token names (`--text-body`, `--text-heading`), not value names (`--font-16`)
- Set `font-kerning: normal` and consider OpenType features where appropriate

### Weight Consistency

- Define clear roles for each weight and stick to them
- Don't use more than 3-4 weights (Regular, Medium, Semibold, Bold is plenty)
- Prefer larger jumps between roles over lots of barely different weights
- Load only the weights you actually use (each weight adds to page load)

### Scale Integrity

- Use `rem` or `px` as source values for the scale, then prefer `rem` in implementation to respect user settings
- Avoid `em`-based type scales in nested UI — descendants quickly drift off-system
- If a scale needs lots of fractional sizes to work, the scale is probably too mathematical and not practical enough

**NEVER**:
- Use more than 2-3 font families
- Pick sizes arbitrarily — commit to a scale
- Set body text below 16px
- Use decorative/display fonts for body text
- Disable browser zoom (`user-scalable=no`)
- Use `em` to define your type scale in nested UI
- Use tiny font sizes just to create hierarchy — use weight or color first
- Center-align long-form text
- Assume a perfect mathematical ratio is better than a hand-crafted scale
- Use `px` for font sizes in implementation — use `rem` to respect user settings
- Default to Inter/Roboto/Open Sans when personality matters
- Pair fonts that are similar but not identical (two geometric sans-serifs)

## Verify Typography Improvements

- **Hierarchy**: Can you identify heading vs body vs caption instantly?
- **Readability**: Is body text comfortable to read in long passages?
- **Consistency**: Are same-role elements styled identically throughout?
- **Personality**: Does the typography reflect the brand?
- **Performance**: Are web fonts loading efficiently without layout shift?
- **Accessibility**: Does text meet WCAG contrast ratios? Is it zoomable to 200%?

Remember: Typography is the foundation of interface design — it carries the majority of information. Getting it right is the highest-leverage improvement you can make.
