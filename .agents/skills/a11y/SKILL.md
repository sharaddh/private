Systematically improve accessibility so the interface works for users with disabilities, temporary impairments, and assistive technology.

This skill focuses on remediation and implementation, not just scoring. It complements `audit` (which measures across dimensions) and `harden` (which handles edge cases broadly). Use this when accessibility is the primary goal.

## MANDATORY PREPARATION

Users start this workflow with `/a11y`. Once this skill is active, load $frontend-design — it contains design principles, anti-patterns, and the **Context Gathering Protocol**. Follow that protocol before proceeding — if no design context exists yet, you MUST load $setup first.

Consult the [accessibility testing reference](../frontend-design/reference/accessibility-testing.md) for automated tool integration (axe, WAVE, Pa11y) and CI workflow guidance.
Consult the [colorblindness UX reference](../frontend-design/reference/colorblindness-ux.md) when color is carrying meaning in states, charts, or validation.
Consult the [component accessibility reference](../frontend-design/reference/component-accessibility.md) for keyboard support, focus handling, skip links, and hidden content patterns.
Consult the [interaction design reference](../frontend-design/reference/interaction-design.md) for focus, loading, transitions, and feedback states.
Consult the [semantic color reference](../frontend-design/reference/semantic-color.md) when checking whether color communicates state or just decoration.
Consult the [responsive design reference](../frontend-design/reference/responsive-design.md) when accessibility needs to adapt across small screens, touch contexts, or zoom levels.

## Assess Accessibility

Identify what is broken and who it affects:

1. **Run automated checks first**:
   - Use axe-core, WAVE, or Pa11y against critical pages
   - Target WCAG 2.1 AA as the baseline
   - Document violations by severity: critical (blocks task), serious (difficult workaround), moderate (annoying), minor (polish)
   - Treat automated results as a fast warning system, not a complete audit

2. **Test keyboard navigation manually**:
   - Unplug the mouse. Can you reach every interactive element?
   - Is the tab order logical and predictable?
   - Are focus indicators visible and clear?
   - Are there keyboard traps (places you cannot tab out of)?
   - Do custom components respond to Enter, Space, Escape, and arrow keys?

3. **Test with a screen reader**:
   - Use NVDA (Windows), VoiceOver (macOS/iOS), or TalkBack (Android)
   - Navigate by headings, landmarks, and form fields
   - Verify that dynamic content changes are announced
   - Check that decorative elements are hidden from assistive technology
   - Confirm that error messages and status updates are read aloud

4. **Check visual accessibility**:
   - Verify contrast ratios: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text, 3:1 for UI components
   - Test at 200% and 400% zoom without horizontal scrolling or content loss
   - Simulate color-vision deficiencies (deuteranopia, protanopia, tritanopia)
   - Ensure color is not the only signal for state or meaning
   - Check that text remains readable when high-contrast mode is enabled

5. **Check motion and animation**:
   - Enable `prefers-reduced-motion` and confirm the interface remains usable
   - Ensure no critical information is hidden behind motion-only reveals
   - Verify that auto-playing content can be paused or stopped

## Remediate by Area

### Semantic HTML

Use the right element for the job. Native HTML elements come with built-in accessibility.

**Fixes**:
- Replace `<div>` or `<span>` buttons with `<button>` elements
- Use `<a>` only for navigation, `<button>` for actions
- Use `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`, `<header>`, `<footer>` for landmarks
- Use `<ul>` / `<ol>` for lists, not styled divs
- Use `<table>` for tabular data, not CSS grid layouts
- Use `<label>` explicitly associated with inputs via `for` attribute
- Use `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` for related form groups

**Anti-patterns to remove**:
- Clickable divs without `role`, `tabindex`, and keyboard handlers
- Headings used only for sizing (`<h1>` through `<h6>` should reflect document structure)
- Placeholder text used as labels
- Empty links or buttons with only icons and no accessible name

### Keyboard Navigation

Every interactive element must be reachable and operable without a mouse.

**Fixes**:
- Ensure all interactive elements have `tabindex="0"` (or are naturally focusable)
- Remove `tabindex="-1"` from elements that should be focusable
- Remove positive `tabindex` values (they create unpredictable order)
- Implement keyboard handlers for custom components:
  - Buttons: Enter and Space activate
  - Toggles: Enter or Space toggle
  - Menus: Enter opens, Escape closes, arrow keys navigate
  - Modals: Tab cycles within, Escape closes, focus returns to trigger
  - Accordions: Enter or Space toggle, arrow keys move between items
- Ensure focus is visible: provide a clear focus ring that is not suppressed by `outline: none` without replacement

### Focus Management

Focus must be intentional, visible, and predictable.

**Fixes**:
- On route change in SPAs, move focus to the new page heading or main content
- When a modal opens, trap focus inside and return focus to the trigger on close
- When a dropdown opens, move focus to the first item
- When an error occurs, move focus to the error summary or first invalid field
- When content is removed, move focus to a logical remaining element (not document.body)
- Do not auto-focus fields on page load unless the user explicitly initiated the action

### ARIA

Use ARIA only when native HTML is insufficient. ARIA does not change behavior, only semantics.

**When to use ARIA**:
- Custom components that have no native HTML equivalent (tabs, tree views, complex menus)
- Landmark regions that need explicit roles
- Live regions for dynamic content announcements
- Accessible names or descriptions that cannot be provided by visible text

**Common ARIA fixes**:
- Add `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"` to modals
- Add `aria-expanded` to disclosure buttons and accordion triggers
- Add `aria-current="page"` to the active navigation item
- Add `aria-live="polite"` or `aria-live="assertive"` to status containers
- Add `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` to icons and icon-only buttons
- Add `aria-describedby` to inputs with helper text or error messages
- Add `aria-invalid="true"` to invalid form fields

**ARIA anti-patterns**:
- Do not add `role="button"` to actual `<button>` elements
- Do not use `aria-hidden="true"` on focusable elements
- Do not use conflicting roles (e.g., `role="button"` on a link)
- Do not nest interactive elements inside each other
- Do not rely on ARIA alone without implementing the corresponding keyboard behavior

### Color and Contrast

Ensure information is perceivable regardless of visual ability.

**Fixes**:
- Meet WCAG AA contrast: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text and UI components
- Never rely on color alone for state, error, or required indicators
- Pair semantic colors with text labels, icons, or shape differences
- Check semantic color ramps under color-vision simulation
- Ensure focus indicators have sufficient contrast against their background
- Provide visible text labels or icons alongside colored status indicators

### Screen Reader Support

Ensure assistive technology users receive equivalent information.

**Fixes**:
- Provide descriptive alt text for informative images; use empty alt for decorative images
- Use `aria-live` regions for dynamic updates (search results, form submissions, notifications)
- Ensure form errors are associated with their fields via `aria-describedby`
- Provide accessible names for all icons, buttons, and controls
- Use headings hierarchically (do not skip levels)
- Mark decorative SVGs with `aria-hidden="true"` or `role="img"` with a title
- Ensure tables have proper `th` headers and `scope` attributes

### Motion and Animation

Respect users who cannot tolerate or do not want motion.

**Fixes**:
- Wrap animations in `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)` or provide reduced-motion alternatives
- For `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`, replace motion with instant state changes or subtle fades
- Do not auto-play video or animations without a pause/stop control
- Ensure parallax and scroll-triggered effects do not cause disorientation
- Respect motion preferences in carousels, slideshows, and onboarding tours

## Verify Improvements

After remediation, verify that fixes work:

- **Re-run automated checks**: confirm previous violations are resolved and no new ones were introduced
- **Keyboard pass**: tab through every interactive element again
- **Screen reader pass**: navigate by headings, landmarks, and form fields
- **Zoom test**: confirm usability at 200% and 400%
- **Color-vision simulation**: confirm states and charts remain distinguishable
- **Reduced motion**: enable `prefers-reduced-motion` and confirm the interface is still usable
- **Real devices**: test on actual assistive technology when possible
